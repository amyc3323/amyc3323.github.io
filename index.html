                <h3>
                    About Me
                </h3>
                <p>
                If I had to describe myself in two words, it would be "creative" and "logical". I think this is quite interesting, because at first, 
                logic and creativity seem like opposites—like oil and water. Logic is confined in strict rules while creativity allows for unlimited 
                possibilities. And for a lot of my life, these qualities of mine have been kept separate. From a young age, I've loved to paint and draw, 
                and every year I seem to find a new creative hobby (like writing or music) that captures my interests for a few months before I inevitably 
                return to art. On the flip side, I’ve also always loved solving logic puzzles and figuring out math problems. <br><br>
                It wasn’t until high school that I realized that these interests could mesh in the form of computer science, and I fell in love with the way that simple lines of text
                 are able to build powerful programs that can change the world. I realized that I was wrong: logic and creativity are not opposites, but 
                 instead complement each other to enable innovation. This realization inspired me to pursue computer science at Carnegie Mellon. Now, 
                 I enjoy combining all my skills in the form of video game development. I love constructing the underlying logic behind the game and watching 
                 as that logic brings my art to life. Because of this, it should come as no surprise that my hobbies involve reading fantasy books, drawing 
                 and 3D modeling, and developing games. Some pieces of media that especially inspire me are <i>Six of Crows</i> by Leigh Bardugo, <i>Epic the 
                    Musical</i> by Jorge Rivera-Herrans, and <i>Big Fish and Begonia (2016)</i>.

                    Art
                </h3>
                <p>
                Art has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember through many different mediums, and I can remember attending 
                art class as early as when I was six. Though I’ve experimented with acrylics, oil pastels, graphite, charcoal, and more, 
                today, I enjoy oil painting, 3D modeling, digital drawing, and animation. One thing I find particularly interesting is how well 
                all my interests and hobbies fit together. For example, I love writing which helps me design characters. Additionally, a lot of the 
                art I’ve done recently has been for game development projects. <br><br>

                Just like with coding, I think the most appealing part of art to me is its unlimited potential: animation makes my drawings come to 
                life, 3D modeling turns my ideas three-dimensional, paintings can capture a space and a feeling. Additionally, I love how art allows 
                me to engage with the content I enjoy. Undertale was the game that inspired me to teach myself digital art, and many other games and 
                movies have inspired me to continue since then. <br><br>

                Beyond that, art has taught me many valuable lessons. Just like how perspective distortion needs to be considered when trying to make 
                a drawing feel solid and three-dimensional, art taught me to look at problems from different perspectives to form my own conclusions. 
                Drawing also allows me to express myself and take time to enjoy my own presence. Overall, while I do enjoy making pretty things, art is 
                more than just that to me: it’s part of my identity and something I hope to never let go. <br><br>

                    Coding
                </h3>
                <p>
                Even though I attend CMU for CS, I didn’t actually learn to code until sophomore year of highschool when I took APCSA. 
                However, I quickly realized that while computer science lends itself to my logical side with its rules and syntax that 
                need to be assembled in particular ways to achieve the desired outcome, it’s also very creative. While coding has its own rules, 
                you can employ the syntax in many creative ways to solve the same problem. <br> <br>

                Overall, I like how this field is a mix of both creativity and logic, reflecting my own strengths and interests, 
                and I like how computer science is being used to creatively change the world by helping people in different ways. 
                During my junior year of high school, I worked on three assistive technology projects that taught me the power of computer 
                science and how it can be used to create devices and apps that solve specific challenges for specific people. Finally, CS is also vast
                 and limitless, just like art. There’s UI/UX, algorithms, mobile app development, video game development, and more. I’ve always enjoyed 
                 learning a variety of different skills and so I like going into a field where there are many options to choose from and pursue. <br><br>

                    Games
                </h3>
                <p>
                I’ve always enjoyed playing video games. They can be fun and stress relieving, but also serve as a way for me to spend time and 
                connect with my friends. However, game development has been the most recent addition to my repertoire of interests. Game development 
                is appealing to me because it combines all of my interests—writing, art, and coding—and I love designing interactive worlds and stories. <br><br>

                In 2023, I attended CMU’s National High School Game Academy (NHSGA) precollege program as an artist. During the six-week program, I 
                learned a lot about Unity and the 3D art pipeline for game asset creation. I also had the opportunity to work in two teams on two game 
                projects as a producer and artist, and one game was even published to the app store! It was an incredible experience that gave me the tools 
                to not only build games, but work in interdisciplinary teams on tight deadlines. <br><Br>

                Because of this, I was thrilled to come back in 2025 as a programming and production TA where I helped teach classes and mentor students. 
                Specifically, I helped develop the introductory programming curriculum and served as a liaison between team producers and the TAs. Beyond that, 
                I loved helping younger students pursue their passions, and seeing the quality of their games really amazed me. NHSGA really cemented a love for 
                game development, and I hope to someday work for a game studio!<br><br>
