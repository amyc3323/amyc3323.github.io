            Here is a summary of all of the games I've worked on. I started learning game development in 2023 at CMU's NHSGA.
            I mainly use Unity, and I usually do pixel art with Aesprite. However, recently I've been dabbling more with 3D art. <br><br>

                    What is the most logical course of action to take in the middle of a zombie apocalypse? Well obviously, you 
                    order a fresh hot pizza! In Pizzapocalypse, you play as a pizza delivery driver, swerving around zombies and 
                    crashing into obstacles to quickly deliver pizzas to your eagerly awaiting customers. The zombies? Well of course, 
                    they're trying to steal your delicious pizza! Deliver pizzas to increase your restaurant’s rating and collect 
                    ingredients to cook even more delicious pizzas. <br><br>

                    This game was made in 3 weeks during the National High School Game Academy program in 2023. Our final presentation
                    presenting Pizzapocalypse can be watched on the left. It's also displayed on the official CMU NHSGA website! I worked with 
                    Dianne Cao, Ethan Kellogg, Ethan Bai, and Henry Shen as the producer and one of two artists. 
                    My main art contributions were the pizza delivery driver (all 16 directions of him!), the street tilemap, and all animations, 
                    but as the producer, I also scheduled all group meetings, planned the timeline, assigned tasks, and managed the team. <br><br>
                    
                    After the program, we went on to publish the game to the Apple appstore, so please check out

                    What are you willing to risk in the pursuit of beauty? It’s tea time in 5 minutes and you’re a 
                    plain piece of cookie dough on the bottom shelf of the tea tray. But everyone knows that the 
                    prettiest pastries are located at the very top. Roll around and parkour to reach the top of the tray 
                    in time for the tea party and collect decorations along the way to become the prettiest. But beware, 
                    ecause beauty comes with a price: each decoration adds to your hitbox, making movement more and more 
                    difficult. Will you make it in time for tea? <br><br>

                    This game was made in 1 week for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2. I worked with Dianne Cao, Ethan Kellogg, 
                    Ethan Bai, and Henry Shen (Team Pineapple again!) as the producer and one of two artists. However, I also 
                    contributed heavily to coding the game and laid out the game scene and UI. My main contributions were 
                    organizing the team, modelling and texturing the tea party sandwiches and tray, and coding the game flow 
                    and high score system.

                    During NHSGA in 2025, the TAs decided to try and develop a game in 3 weeks alongside the students. 
                    Thus, we came up with an overcooked-style game where you play as us, the TAs, rushing around a modified 
                    version of the Entertainment Technology Center while trying to “solve” student issues through various 
                    hyperbolized minigames. <br><br>

                    This game is a networked multiplayer game made by all fourteen NHSGA TAs. I organized the game document, drew the character reference sheet 
                    for the models of each TA, and also drew and laid out some of the simpler UI. I also drew the logo! For programming, my main contribution 
                    was creating the Unity animator minigame where the player is tasked with finding missing transitions in a replica of 
                    Unity's animator in order to solve the minigame.

                In an Australian wildfire,  team up with a cockatoo to fight for the last safe tree in a wildfire. 
                Kick down the enemy robot kangaroos, dodge snipers and boomerangs, and claim the tree as your own. 
                Survive for as long as possible as more enemies swarm around you. This game is based on the arcade game 
                <i> Jouse </i> and tries to replicate the mechanics and feel of the original game while adding a new theme and 
                gameplay mechanics. <br><br>

                As a “trial run” for NHSGA, students first go through a lightning round where they are put into a team and 
                given one week to recreate a classic arcade game but with a new stylistic theme. I worked with Finn Murphy, 
                Kishi Wijaya and Katherine Thesling as a solo artist and producer. We were assigned the game <i>Joust </i> and 
                wanted to preserve its original goofy chaos. After a bit of brainstorming, we settled on the idea of boxing kangaroos 
                and the idea just took off. I drew all of the sprites and animations in the game, including the intro cutscene.

                As someone who did not know how to code until 11th grade, I was really excited to be 
                brought back to NHSGA as a programming TA for the beginning programming class. As a part 
                of this job, not only did I get to teach a few of the classes, but I got to help develop the c
                urriculum with both beginner and non-programmers in mind. We decided that a good way of teaching 
                both C# and Unity was to walk the students through building a very simple game. This style would provide 
                structure and an understanding of what was expected, but allowed for full creativity. Plus students would 
                walk away at the end with a finished product. <br><br>

                While building this game, we taught students many topics ranging from maneuvering around in Unity and colliders 
                to  singletones and coroutines. Working with an ETC faculty member and another TA, I helped to design and program 
                the game while creating lesson plans to teach the students. Though the game isn’t the most advanced, a lot of thought 
                went into how it could be created in a beginner-friendly way.

                Threadbound is an ongoing project of mine based on a short story I wrote in 2024. 
                The story takes place on a waterlogged planet where land is rare and storms are frequent. In this world, 
                there is a myth that if you throw a bottle into the sea with a keepsake of a lost loved one, they will be 
                able to find their way home. The protagonist, Amaya, has the magical ability to see threads in bottles that 
                link people together. She sets out to try and reunite these people, all while searching for her brother along the way. <br><br>

                This game was started as both a way for me to get more familiar with Unity, but also as a game design exercise to see how 
                I can translate the elements of my world into an interactive game. Unfortunately, I’ve been stuck on how to make the sailing 
                feel good in the game and haven’t proceeded. I am currently debating on starting over in 3D.
